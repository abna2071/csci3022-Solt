This is the same as what was assumed in the earlier parts of the problem, so the estimate should be similar to the theorhetical probabilities. Note that in the last computation, the choices for the second movement must be redetermined to ensure they that the two octopi's movements are independent. They estimate should also improve with the number of trials used."

But, as you approach the water, night falls, a bad storm rolls in, and you’re forced to wait until morning to try to cross. Overnight, the storm could render some of the bridges unusable — it has a 50 percent chance of knocking out each of the bridges. (The chance is independent for each bridge.)\n",
